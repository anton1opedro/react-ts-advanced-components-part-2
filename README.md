# React TypeScript Advanced Components

This project showcases advanced React component patterns and techniques using TypeScript. It builds on basic React+TS knowledge to demonstrate reusable, flexible, and type-safe components for complex UI scenarios.

## Features

- Advanced component composition
- Higher-order components (HOCs)
- Render props pattern
- Controlled and uncontrolled components
- Custom hooks with TypeScript
- Context API usage with strong typing
- Type-safe event handling and props
